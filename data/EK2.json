Here are some key signs to watch for:\n\n- Behavioral Indicators: Guests appear submissive, avoid eye contact, or seem fearful in the presence of others.\n- Unusual Activities: Frequent visitors to a room at odd hours, large amounts of cash, or drug paraphernalia.\n- Booking Patterns: Bulk room bookings under one name, refusal of housekeeping services, or cash-only payments.\n- Physical Signs: Bruising, branding tattoos, or malnourishment.\n\nActionable Skills for Hotel Staff\n- Observation: Be alert to guest behavior and identify patterns of control or distress.\n- Documentation: Record observations discreetly, including dates, times, room numbers, and descriptions.\n- Reporting: Notify your supervisor or security team promptly, avoiding direct confrontation.\n- Situational Awareness: Be vigilant for signs like guests denying cleaning services or unusual room requests.\n\nInteractive Role-Playing Exercise\nThis training includes role-playing scenarios where participants will practice:\n\n- Identifying potential indicators of trafficking.\n- Documenting observations effectively.\n- Reporting findings to the appropriate personnel.\n\nExample Scenario:\n\nA visitor frequently arrives at unusual hours and interacts with multiple individuals in a single room. Participants will discuss the appropriate steps to report this activity while maintaining guest safety and confidentiality.\n\nSurvivor Accounts\nThroughout the training, you will hear stories from survivors who share their experiences. These powerful accounts highlight the importance of vigilance and underscore the critical role hotel staff play in preventing trafficking.\n\nIncorporating Audiovisual Content\nVideos will be used to enhance the training experience. These include:\n\n- An overview of human trafficking.\n- Survivor testimonials to foster understanding and empathy.\n- Demonstrations of how to handle suspected trafficking situations.\n\nData and Insights\nUnderstanding the scale and impact of human trafficking is essential. Here are some statistics:\n\n- Human trafficking generates billions of dollars in illegal profits annually.\n- The average age of entry into trafficking is under 18 years old.\n- Over 70% of trafficking victims are women and girls.\n\nSearching for Indicators Online\nHotel staff should remain vigilant for trafficking activity that may be associated with the hotel:\n\n- Search for ads on websites that may list the hotel's address.\n- Utilize tools like THORN or STOPLIGHT to track phone numbers or activities linked to trafficking.\n\nPartnerships\nOur hotel partners with local and national anti-trafficking organizations to:\n\n- Provide safe housing and resources for victims.\n- Facilitate training for hotel employees.\n- Collaborate with law enforcement to address trafficking effectively.\n\nLaw Enforcement Collaboration\nHotel staff are encouraged to work closely with law enforcement to ensure appropriate responses to suspected trafficking. This includes:\n\n- Reporting detailed observations such as room numbers, times, and guest descriptions.\n- Collaborating with officers to provide critical evidence without disrupting ongoing investigations.\n\nEnhanced Detection Skills\n- Attention to Detail: Notice anomalies such as reluctance to provide identification or unusual visitor patterns.\n- Recognizing Patterns: High room turnover, refusal of cleaning services, or guests congregating in hallways.\n- Identifying Evidence: Items like condoms, drug paraphernalia, or large amounts of cash in trash cans.\n\nConclusion\nBy participating in this training, you are helping to protect vulnerable individuals and make your hotel a safe and secure environment.
