What is Human Trafficking?

Human trafficking is the exploitation of individuals through force, fraud, or coercion for the purpose of labor or commercial sex. It's a global issue that affects millions, including vulnerable adults and children. Traffickers prey on those seeking a better life, often using promises of legitimate jobs, education, or romantic relationships to lure their victims.

Why Hotels?

Hotels, unfortunately, can be targeted by traffickers due to their anonymity, accessibility, and potential for temporary lodging.  Being aware of this is the first step to prevention.

Statistics that Matter:

Human trafficking is a multi-billion dollar criminal industry impacting nearly **[Insert current statistic] **victims worldwide.
The average age of entry into sex trafficking is [Insert current statistic] years old.
Traffickers utilize online platforms, including those used to advertise hotel rooms, to conduct their illegal activities.
Recognizing the Signs:

While victims may not always be easily identifiable,  certain indicators can raise red flags:

Guest Behavior: A guest appears fearful, anxious, or submissive, especially towards another guest. They may avoid eye contact or seem restricted in their movement or speech.
Unusual Activity: The guest has an excessive number of visitors at odd hours. You notice large amounts of cash being exchanged. Condoms, lubricant, or drug paraphernalia are observed in the room or disposed of unusually.
Control Dynamics: One person seems to be controlling another's actions, answers questions on their behalf, or speaks for them. You notice signs of physical abuse, malnourishment, or branding on a guest.
Suspicious Bookings: Large blocks of rooms are booked under one name with multiple occupants per room. Guests pay for rooms in cash, refuse housekeeping services, or request a room change soon after check-in.
Remember: A single sign alone may not signify trafficking, but a combination of factors should prompt further observation and reporting. Victims may:

Appear subdued and avoid eye contact.
Have few personal belongings.
Exhibit signs of physical abuse, malnourishment, or branding.
Seem disoriented or unaware of their location.

Skills to Confirm Human Trafficking Through Indicators and Circumstances
Recognizing the signs of human trafficking requires attentiveness, familiarity with common indicators, and the ability to notice inconsistencies that may signal potential trafficking situations. Here are some key skills and indicators that can assist in identifying suspicious activity:

1. Attention to Detail and Awareness of Anomalies
It’s essential to stay alert to anything that seems unusual or out of place. Trusting your instincts and taking note of specific anomalies can help build a more accurate picture of suspicious activities. This includes:

Observing guest interactions and checking for signs of control or distress.
Noticing reluctance or fear from guests when communicating with staff.
Picking up on inconsistencies in guests’ stories or behaviors.
2. Multiple Guests in One Room
A red flag may arise when a room booked for one or two guests has an unusually high number of visitors. Indicators of trafficking-related activity include:

A steady flow of different individuals entering and exiting a specific room, especially at irregular hours.
Non-registered guests frequenting the room or congregating in hallways nearby.
3. Incriminating Trash
Items found in trash cans or rooms can also hint at potential trafficking. Be mindful of:

Discarded items that may indicate exploitation, such as excessive condoms, lubricants, or drug paraphernalia.
Large amounts of food wrappers or takeaway packaging, suggesting limited movement or isolation.
Identification documents or property not belonging to registered guests.
4. Refusal of Cleaning Services
Traffickers may deny housekeeping services to prevent hotel staff from entering the room and noticing suspicious items or individuals. Signs to watch for include:

Guests who repeatedly refuse cleaning services for extended stays.
Requests for fresh linens, towels, or other room items at odd hours or multiple times a day.
5. General Suspicious Behavior
Suspicious behaviors alone may not confirm trafficking but, when combined with other indicators, can point to potential exploitation. Examples include:

Guests appearing unusually anxious or submissive, or a guest controlling the conversation or actions of others.
Guests with visible injuries, malnourishment, or clothing that is inappropriate for the weather or time of day.
Guests who are disoriented, unsure of their location, or unable to provide basic personal details about themselves.
These skills and observations can help you recognize warning signs more effectively. Always remember, if you observe multiple indicators of trafficking, document your observations discreetly and report them immediately to a supervisor or security personnel, as outlined in our training.
