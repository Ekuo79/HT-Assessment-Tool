sexual exploitation of children.

Human trafficking is criminal activity in which human beings are coerced, forced, or
deceived into an exploitative situation for another person's monetary gain.
Human trafficking is the second-largest and fastest-growing criminal industry in the world.
Most commonly the purpose is for sex and or labor.
All those involved in recruiting, receiving, or obtaining the person for that purpose
have committed a trafficking crime.
Human trafficking and the commercial sexual exploitation of children are violations of human
rights, international law, and the laws of many countries.
For example, in the United States, the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act
of 2000, TVPA, and in the United Kingdom, the Modern Slavery Act 2015, state that it is
illegal to monetarily benefit by exploiting a person.
Many hoteliers would find it hard to believe that human trafficking can occur at their properties.
However, exploitation occurs across a varied spectrum of properties, from locally-owned
motels to luxury chain establishments.
It only takes one case of trafficking to be uncovered in a property to have serious consequences
for the business.
Click on each risk area to learn more about the safety, reputational, financial, and
legal risks your property may face.
Money is often connected to other criminal activities, including drugs and violent assault,
which can jeopardize the safety of hotel guests and associates.
Our employees and customers mean everything to us.
If they hear of a case in the news, this can cause employees and customers to lose trust
in our company and damage a property's reputation.
A property's bottom line can be impacted by negative publicity, legal fees, business
interruptions, and property damage associated with trafficking.
Various state and local laws could hold hoteliers liable for trafficking that occurs at their
properties.


Human trafficking does not just affect faraway places, it is happening in cities and suburbs
all over the world.
There is no one face of human trafficking.
Victims come from all backgrounds and include women, men, and children.
Traffickers often target vulnerable populations, including people living in poverty and run
away or homeless children.
But risk teenagers and victims of abuse are also vulnerable potential targets.
Victims from other countries may be lured to our country through the promise of school
or work, or even sold to traffickers by their families.
Traffickers use very specific measures to target, manipulate, and maintain their victims.
Victims are often threatened with violence to themselves, their friends, or family.
They are often isolated from any relationships.
Victims can often become addicted to illegal drugs and are ruled through fear and manipulation.
As hospitality employees, we are the eyes and ears of the hotel.
In this section, we will focus on sex trafficking.
With the growth of technology, traffickers are moving their businesses off the streets
and onto the internet.
The same websites that sell used furniture and appliances sometimes have sections where
traffickers are selling their victims.
Unbeknownst to employees, traffickers may check into a hotel and run their operations
out of rooms or use the rooms to meet with buyers.
Traffickers think that hotels are anonymous and low risk.
No trafficking victims should go unnoticed.
Sadly, this happens all too frequently.
Instances of sex trafficking are not always easy to spot.
You must look for subtle signs and notice unusual behaviors, including the following indicators
to identify the trafficker.
Pays for the room in cash, one day at a time.
Escorts various men into the room and lingers until they leave, watching the door.
Seen with many young persons or children exhibiting signs of trafficking, requests for isolated
private rooms or rooms close to an exit, does not leave the victim alone, continuously
receiving and making calls from their cell phone, victims often wear revealing clothing
or too much makeup and have little or no luggage, victims may be drugged and disoriented
or simply too scared to run away, as traffickers often get their victims addicted to drugs and
deprived them of sleep as a means of control.
In some cultures, branding is a way for traffickers to mark their victims and to make the victim
feel as though they belong to the trafficker.
Comparable to the branding of cattle, traffickers commonly use the same tattoo to brand each
of their victims and signal his or her ownership.
It is important to note that one sign on its own does not indicate sex trafficking
or the commercial sexual exploitation of children.
Use your professional judgment to review situations, but be sure to report your suspicions
to management.

Victims are often facing extreme poverty and are manipulated through lies about work and financial opportunities. Recruiters can be family members or seemingly legitimate businesses looking for employees. 

Victims often believe they must work against their will or to pay off debt. Labor trafficking can occur in all businesses and our industry is in a unique role to identify. potential victims. As community members, we need to look out for each other. 

Victims of labor trafficking are forced into exploitative work situations, are paid little, and are unable to leave. They are often mistreated, deprived of sleep, and isolated from the community so they believe they are alone and cannot ask for help. 

Traffickers target victims who do not speak the language of the country and those staying on beyond the expiration of their visa status. The following are common indicators for labor trafficking. Disoriented, confused, lacking sleep, or showing signs of abuse, not in possession of passports, other travel, or identity documents. 

Fearful or timid of authority figures may avoid eye contact, afraid of revealing their immigration status. Same attire. or little belongings, unable to communicate freely or coached on what to say, malnourished, injuries at different stages of healing, and or lack of medical care. 

It is important to note that one sign on its own does not indicate labor trafficking. Use your professional judgment to review situations but be sure to report your suspicions to management.
